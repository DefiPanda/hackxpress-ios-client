Hackxpress-ios-client is a simple iOS client for [hackxpress](http://hackxpress.herokuapp.com), a site that aims to let the user be a better programmer through learning from most meaningful questions from stackexchange. With over 3,000 users of Hackxpress website during the first four days of launch, I think making an iOS app will make the user access the content easier from an iPhone device.
  
The app targets all forms of iPhone devices. Currently it is in beta and does not support landscape orientation.
